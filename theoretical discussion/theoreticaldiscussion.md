## Digital Scholarship

Building tools that use computational methods to address intellectual ideas, while bringing those ideas to bear on how those tools are used

Applies system level thinking to social, cultural, and intellectual issues

The use of digital evidence, methods of inquiry, research, publication and preservation to achieve scholarly and research goals.

Encompasses both scholarly communication using digital media and research on digital media

## Alvarado: The Digital Humanities Situation

The typical digital humanist is a literary scholar, historian, librarians or students

Traditional fields concerned with the management and interpretation of written documents

Complexity of the field is also multiplied by the modes of relationship that may characterize the intersection between computation and textuality in each case

Zotero fits the intersection between computation and textuality

Zotero is a software tool that allows the user to archive research findings they may come across

To a humanist, any computational technology is potentially tool, text and metaphor

Many scholars supplement their research by using data management tools to organize notes and references

Zotero is a management tool to organize citations and research

The center of gravity is not an assemblage of technologies or methods but the ongoing, playful encounter with digital representation itself

Quantitative representations of knowledge through different fields of study such as math through numbers, geography through mapping, and English through literature

Zotero represents knowledge through citations and research collection

## Kirschenbaum: What Is Digital Humanities and What’s It Doing in English Departments?

To counter Kirschenbaum, digital humanities requires theoretical analysis and discussion 

Zotero is a tool that benefits scholars and helps them to attain knowledge through research findings

“So what is digital humanities, and what is it doing in English departments?”
