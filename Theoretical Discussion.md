“Digital Scholarship: The development and use of digital and collaborative technologies to collect, analyze, and represent data within academic disciplines” (IASC Handbook, 2017).

Important roles digital tools play in helping scholars achieve theiracademic goals in a variety of disciplines. 

Digital scholarship examines how scholars can use digital technologies, such as Google A&C and Serendip-o-matic, to analyze work within their academic discipline. Through this, scholars can analyze digital scans of historical works, such as old paintings and texts, in detail on a&c. This can allow them to comfortably view their work from the comfort of their offices or home without having to travel across the world to see the full effect of the chosen work.

*The display of information […] can easily use standard metrics. Par. 25
Subjective information, that is information whose constitution exhibits its subjective character, deviates from the standard norms by using graphic variables such as intensity of tone, size, color, or other feature to embody its qualities.
Subjective information can use graphical means to show its inflected character, demonstrating its deviation from standard norms in the way the display looks, or, in dynamic displays, the way it acts. Par. 26 - Drucker*

Serendip-o-matic demonstrates a deviation from the text to exhibit an entirely new perspective based on its own algorithmic interpretation. It uses keywords to decipher how to best represent the text through public pictures.
The behavior of the program is reflected in the order of keywords it deems important and the types of media it assigns to those keywords. 
It’s hard to say whether Serendip-o-matic would be more effective if it’s algorithm could also detect the context of words, the form/medium of text, or even build upon its knowledge of text inputs to become more accurate. If it could learn to interpret the text a specific way would its results evolve to represent a certain bias or deviate from the information given entirely? Would it become more objective or subjective when given multiple perspectives at once?
