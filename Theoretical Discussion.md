“Digital Scholarship: The development and use of digital and collaborative technologies to collect, analyze, and represent data within academic disciplines” (IASC Handbook, 2017).

Important roles digital tools play in helping scholars achieve theiracademic goals in a variety of disciplines. 

Digital scholarship examines how scholars can use digital technologies, such as Google A&C and Serendip-o-matic, to analyze work within their academic discipline. Through this, scholars can analyze digital scans of historical works, such as old paintings and texts, in detail on a&c. This can allow them to comfortably view their work from the comfort of their offices or home without having to travel across the world to see the full effect of the chosen work.
