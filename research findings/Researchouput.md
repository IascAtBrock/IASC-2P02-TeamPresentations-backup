## Discuss your ability to make multimodal arguments using the tool. What ideas, thoughts, concepts, or interpretations were you able to express in a multimodal form? Was there anything you couldnâ€™t express?

Zotero cannot make many different multimodal arguments within the tool. Anything researched is in written form. Using the tool, it can research findings for what you are looking for but then only save it. It cannot create a video or a picture but it can research it for you and cite where it came from.

## Discuss the overall usability of the tool based on your experience. Could you use it to conduct research for future courses?

Zotero can be used for any class. It is a reference manager. Any website that you visit can be stored and managed within Zotero. Any article or book can be saved and referenced. You would save whatever article you used and then Zotero would create a citation for it. Zotero would be very helpful with English essays and research papers.
