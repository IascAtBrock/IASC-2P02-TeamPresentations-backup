## Discuss your ability to make multimodal arguments using the tool. What ideas, thoughts, concepts, or interpretations were you able to express in a multimodal form? Was there anything you couldn’t express?

Zotero can use multimodal features. (PDF’s, images, audio and video files snapshots of web pages etc.) All these features can be saved and referenced for the user within Zotero.

## Discuss the overall usability of the tool based on your experience. Could you use it to conduct research for future courses?

Zotero can be used for any class. It is a reference manager. Any website that you visit can be stored and managed within Zotero. Any article or book can be saved and referenced. You would save whatever article you used and then Zotero would create a citation for it. Zotero would be very helpful with English essays and research papers.
