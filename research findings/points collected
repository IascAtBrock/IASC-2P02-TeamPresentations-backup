It invites discussion by providing differing views on texts. However, the website doesn’t have a chat or comment feature (probably because it was initially intended to be used by teachers and students and that could get bad). This can stunt the development of discussion as it gives no opening for dialogue to begin.
-its best used by teachers as a tool to help students analyse literature. We see a lot of texts with facets related to literary terms (like metaphors, foreshadowing) and character development et cetera whatever.
