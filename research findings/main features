Main features. 
Hypercities is a digital media and learning project which focuses on a collaboration of historical layers of city spaces. It is basically a time travel application that shows the viewer the past present and future of city spaces. They show the diversity of the people that live, and have lived in the different places. Due to the fact that everyone can contribute content the everyone can tell their own story through both time and space (place). 

This one is pretty self explanatory. A series of maps are overlaid onto the same location these maps are all taken from different times and you can see the progression and development of each location.

 The timeline is usually located at the top so the viewer can easily scroll through what time they are looking at. This timeline can be contracted or expanded to see a variety of maps.  To specify the timeline value is years so youâ€™re scrolling through the different historical maps.

 There are different collections that you can look through for each that they are divided into two main sections public collections and external collections. The public collections are different publications like historical material, academic content and personal recollections. The external collections are information that was not directly inserted into hyperlinks but pulled from different website.
