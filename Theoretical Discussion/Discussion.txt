**Theoretical Discussion**

**James Murray**

The tool Hypercities touches on two important concepts in digital scholarship. The first is that it is an example of the 
“playful encounter with digital representation”, as outlined in Alvarado’s The Digital Humanities Situation. To Alvarado, this is one of 
the two dimensions that form the digital humanities, and can be summarized as the way of “putting things together”. He further specifies 
that the digital humanities are based on the “Mapping the objects and categories of scholarship onto the rapidly changing, intrinsically 
plastic but structurally constraining media of digital technology”. In this case, the scholarly objects in question are the historical 
documents and information that the user overlaid onto the digital mapping service, which can be accounted as the “media of digital 
technology”. Alvarado’s discussion promotes the use of a tool such as Hypercities to do just this, create a synergy between scholarly \
articles and digital tools and artifacts.

The second concept is that of capta vs. data, as coined by Drucker. In her article, she states that the representation of information is
not based on quantitative empirical data, such as statistics and graphs, but through capta, where information is interpreted by the 
viewer, and thus the information is created with their own beliefs, thoughts and biases in place. Hypercities displays the use of capta 
as the creator of each specific map looks at what is can be considered data (maps created by GIS software) and implement historical 
context and specific narrative over it, which can be considered the cohesion of capta and data.

Our group divided our presentation in to pieces that each of us would work on, and separately upload to Github. It was here that we could
access each other’s work and gain insight into the process in which they think and work. in future collaborative work, it seems that the
issues tab will become very useful as it acts as some form of bug reporting system, where members can alert others to inconsistencies or 
errors in either their own work or those around them.
