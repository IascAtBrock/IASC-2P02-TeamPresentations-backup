"To a humanist, any computational technology is potentially tool, text, and metaphor." 

Much like digital humanities itself is a crosslist of all kinda of interdiscplinary subjects combining into one curriculum, HC uses the web platform as a way to turn everyones discvipline, whether it is arts, literary theory, greek literature and history etc. they all have a space there, using this digital tool. 

"Digital Humanities.... an interrelated collection of subject domains and resources that, as a whole, contirbutes to both the construction of knowledge and the education of people."
